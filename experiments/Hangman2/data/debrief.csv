I thought they would take longer and guess wrong letters on purpose, to make it seem like they didn't know. The ""taylor swift"" one, and especially the ""tooth"" one seemed obvious to me from the first few letters, so it felt drawn out on purpose.

However, if I figured out the answer too quickly, I tended to slow down intentionally in order to seem like I was still figuring things out. The most difficult thing about pretending wasn't that I knew the answer, but rather that the answer was unusual. ""Dalai Lama"" was one example of this. I wouldn't ever figure that out on my own. I would think the answer was a celebrity or athlete. Knowing the answer beforehand actually made things harder because I knew I eventually needed to give my correct answer, but I didn't know when to do so. I ended up stalling for a long time to pretend like I didn't know what the answer was, but it wasn't realistic. I would've ended up waiting 5 minutes or longer if I really wanted to make things realistic, but I didn't want to waste time doing that. As for telling which players who were pretenders, I had the strategy of seeing if anyone took extra long to answer obvious answers. That would mean they were pretending. However, I was wrong. For example, I thought for certain if a person had ""Taylor S___T"" that they would immediately find the answer. When the person stalled for a super long time, I thought they were just pretending. Apparently, they really were actually taking a super long time to figure out that it was Taylor Swift.
