# Pretending not to know

Matan Mazor üôà, Chaz Firestone üôâ & Ian Phillips üôä

<img src="docs/figures/methods2.png" alt="Experimental Design in Exp. 1 (upper panel) and 2 (lower panel). In non-pretend games, players revealed ships by guessing cells in a grid (A) or revealed a word by guessing letters (D). In pretend games, we marked ship locations with a cross (B) and revealed the target word from the start (E), but asked players to play as if they didn‚Äôt have this information. Lastly, players watched replays of the games of previous players and guessed which were pretend games (C and F)." width="700"/>

A series of experiments looking at people's ability to pretend they don't know something.

## Data

Raw data from all four experiments is available on the project's OSF repository: [osf.io/zma9b/](https://osf.io/zma9b/files/osfstorage/).

## Analysis Scripts

[All pre-registered analyses](https://github.com/matanmazor/ignorance/blob/main/docs/preregisteredMethodsAndResults.Rmd), [exploratory analyses](https://github.com/matanmazor/ignorance/blob/main/docs/ExploratoryResults.Rmd), and [the paper itself in a data-to-paper Rmarkdown format](https://github.com/matanmazor/ignorance/blob/main/docs/paper.Rmd) are available in the 'docs' subdirectory.


The outputs of the scripts are available in gitbook format (both [preregistered](https://self-model.github.io/pretendingNotToKnow/docs/exp.-1-battleship.html) and [exploratory](https://self-model.github.io/pretendingNotToKnow/docs/exp.-1-battleship-exploratory-results.html) analyses).

To reproduce the paper, follow these steps:

1) The scripts use the R [groundhog package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/groundhog/index.html) for version control. This package needs to be installed. The package also requires that the scripts are run on R version 4.2.2 ("Innocent and Trusting"). It should be possible to run it on newer versions, but then the calls to groundhog.library would need to specify a more recent date. 

2) The scripts should be run in the order 'preregisteredMethodsAndResults.Rmd','exploratoryResults.Rmd', and only then 'paper.Rmd'. The reason is that the first two scripts save their output as RData files, which the third scripts reads. All scripts can be found in the 'docs' folder.

## Experiment demos

You can try [demos of the two experiments](https://self-model.github.io/pretendingNotToKnow/experiments/demos/pretend), as experienced by our participants.

## Pre-registration and pre-registration time-locking üïùüîí

OSF pre-registrations are available for [Battleship](https://osf.io/v9zsb) and [Hangman](https://osf.io/3thry).

To ensure preregistration time-locking (in other words, that preregistration preceded data collection), we employed [randomization-based preregistration](https://medium.com/@mazormatan/cryptographic-preregistration-from-newton-to-fmri-df0968377bb2). We used the SHA256 cryptographic hash function to translate our preregistered protocol folder (including the pre-registration document) to a string of 256 bits. These bits were then combined with the unique identifiers of single subjects, and the resulting string was used as seed for initializing the Mersenne Twister pseudorandom number generator prior to determining all random aspects of the experiment, including the order of game boards (grid configurations or target words) presented to participants, and their assignment of boards to experimental conditions. This way, experimental randomization was causally dependent on, and therefore could not have been determined prior to, the specific contents of our preregistration document ([Mazor, Mazor & Mukamel, 2019](https://doi.org/10.1111/ejn.14278)).

‚ö†Ô∏è Notice that the due to an error in the experimental code, only the second batch of Hangman participants was effectively time-locked. [See here](https://github.com/matanmazor/ignorance/blob/0015bfeb46b9b85e3e25304671d943335cca4a53/experiments/Hangman2/whyIsThereTwoOfEverything.txt).
