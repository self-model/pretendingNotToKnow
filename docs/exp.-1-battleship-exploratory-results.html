<p>To get at subtler dynamics in a more direct way, in a follow-up exploratory analysis we focused on decision latencies following a hit. We categorized hits into four types: first hit on a ship, second hit on a ship when the size-three submarine hasn’t been sunk yet, second hit on a ship when the size-three submarine has already been sunk, and third hit on a submarine. In the first case, players know the ship must continue in one of the neighboring cells. In the second case, there is a good chance the ship continues (if this ship turns out to be a submarine). In the third and fourth cases, it is clear that the ship is fully sunk.</p>
<p>In non-pretend games, participants were significantly slower to select the next cell when they knew they had just completed a ship (categories 3 and 4) compared to when they just hit a ship, but were not sure (category 2) or knew they had not completely sunk it (category 1; <span class="math inline">\(t(404) = -16.82\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; .001\)</span>). Specifically, we find that participants were slower by 728 ms to make the next cell selection after hitting the second cell of a ship if the size-three submarine had already been sunk (<span class="math inline">\(t(404) = 13.45\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; .001\)</span>).</p>
<p>Strikingly, we found the exact same pattern in pretend games. Players were faster to make the next cell selection when they pretended to think that the current ship might not be fully sunk (<span class="math inline">\(t(369) = -14.47\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; .001\)</span>). This was not merely a difference between the first, second and third hits: participants were slower by 754 ms to make the next cell selection after hitting the second cell of a ship if the size-three submarine had already been sunk (<span class="math inline">\(t(404) = 13.45\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; .001\)</span>). Further analysis confirmed that this effect remained significant when controlling for click number (<span class="math inline">\(t(404) = 11.28\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; .001\)</span>), and when restricting the analysis to the second hit of a ship that is in fact of size-two (<span class="math inline">\(t(366) = 3.91\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; .001\)</span>).</p>
<p>This last finding bears emphasizing: In both classes two and three, pretenders <em>knew</em> that they had just sunk a size-two ship, but in the second case they <em>pretended not to know</em> this fact, and this affected their response latency in the same way it would have been affected had they been in a non-pretend game.</p>

<p>Our optimality analysis showed that pretenders’ click selections closely resemble those of non-pretenders, at least in that they are not random, but rather guided by where a ship might be. However, due to the high number of possible board configurations, data from full games provide limited opportunity to compare cell selections for specific game states. In addition to asking, “What guides cell selections in pretend and non-pretend games?”, we also wanted to ask, “Where exactly would pretenders and non-pretenders click, given a specific board configuration?”.</p>
<p>To achieve this, the sixth game in each block started not with an empty grid, but with the contents of some cells already revealed by a previous player. As before, pretenders also knew where the remaining ships were hidden, but tried to play as if they only knew what was known to this previous player. Having cell selections from 250 players for each board configuration and condition allowed us to plot and compare the distribution of clicks under a genuine, or pretend, knowledge state.</p>
<p>In the third column we plot the distribution of clicks for non-pretend players. This distribution is in agreement with the hit probability map (board A: <span class="math inline">\(r = .81\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([.55, .93]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(16) = 5.48\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; .001\)</span>; board B: <span class="math inline">\(r = .87\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([.68, .95]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(16) = 7.01\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; .001\)</span>). Finally, in the fourth column we plot the distribution of cell selections for pretend players. Although noisier, this distribution is also in agreement with the hit probability map (board A: <span class="math inline">\(r = .49\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([.03, .78]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(16) = 2.27\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .037\)</span>; board B: <span class="math inline">\(r = .73\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([.40, .89]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(16) = 4.28\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .001\)</span>), and more importantly, with the hit distribution of non-pretenders for the same board configuration (board A: <span class="math inline">\(r = .58\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([.15, .82]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(16) = 2.83\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .012\)</span>, board B: <span class="math inline">\(r = .87\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([.69, .95]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(16) = 7.23\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; .001\)</span>).</p>

<p>In Battleship, players sometimes have a fixed sequence of clicks that they follow, at least for the first moves. To quantify this, we plot the distribution of the first 5 clicks from all all games of a random subset of 100 players:</p>
<div class="figure"><span style="display:block;" id="fig:get-Battleship-prior"></span>
<img src="figs/get-Battleship-prior-1.png" alt="Distribution of the first 5 clicks in all games, from a subset of 100 random players" width="1800" />
<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>As can be seen, subjects prefer to click on the diagonals, with a slight preference for the left hand side. We then asked how well aligned are players’ clicks with this map in pretend and non-pretend games. For this analysis, we only used data from the remaining 380 players whose games were not used for generating the above map.</p>
<p><img src="figs/battleship-prior-comparison-1.png" width="1800" /></p>
<p>We find no difference in this measure between pretend and non-pretend games (<span class="math inline">\(t(379) = -1.51\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .131\)</span>). In the next analysis we use a more sensitive, player-specific measure of players’ tendency to follow a fixed heuristic, versus playing flexibly.</p>
</div>
<div id="variability-in-number-of-misses" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="1.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Variability in number of misses<a href="exp.-1-battleship-exploratory-results.html#variability-in-number-of-misses" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>We quantified the within-subject variability in the number of misses in pretend and non-pretend games. This is a function of how similar games were to each other, within condition and within individual. The standard deviation in non-pretend games was on average 2.60, and significantly higher than in pretend games (mean SD = 1.58, <span class="math inline">\(t(479) = 18.12\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; .001\)</span>). In other words, pretend games were significantly more similar to each other, in number of guesses, than non-pretend games were to each other.</p>
<!-- Next, we asked whether pretend games were not only more similar among themselves, but also to the average non-pretend game, than were non-pretend games. We therefore replaced the $\mu_{pretend}$ in the standard deviation formula with $\mu_{non-pretend}$: $\sigma'=\sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\Sigma_{i=1}^{N} (x_{i}-\mu_{non-pretend})^2}$. Here, a typical pretend game was less similar, in number of misses, to the average non-pretend game, than was a typical non-pretend game ($M = -0.23$, 95\% CI $[-0.39, -0.07]$, $t(479) = -2.85$, $p = .005$). -->

<div id="within-participant-sequential-guess-entropy" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="1.5">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.5</span> Within-participant sequential guess entropy<a href="exp.-1-battleship-exploratory-results.html#within-participant-sequential-guess-entropy" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>In this analysis, we asked how flexible players were in their click sequences, across games. We quantified flexibility as the Shannon entropy of cell selections across games, for a given click number. For example, if a player always started their games by clicking in the top left corner, their flexibility score for the first click will be <span class="math inline">\(H([1,1,1,1,1])=0\)</span>. Flexibility was quantified separately for pretend and non-pretend games.</p>
<p><img src="figs/battleship-flexibility-plot-1.png" width="1800" /></p>
<p>Flexibility scores increased as a function of click number for both pretend and non-pretend games, as expected if players adjust their behavior based on the outcomes of previous clicks. This process reached a plateau of around <span class="math inline">\(H=2.1\)</span> at click number 6.</p>
<p>Importantly, before that point, flexibility was persistently lower in pretend games (click #1: <span class="math inline">\(t(479) = -3.93\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; .001\)</span>; click #2: <span class="math inline">\(t(479) = -3.40\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .001\)</span>; click #3: <span class="math inline">\(t(479) = -4.88\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; .001\)</span>; click #4: <span class="math inline">\(t(479) = -3.26\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .001\)</span>; click #5: <span class="math inline">\(t(479) = -2.64\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .009\)</span>).</p>
<p>We reasoned that this tendency to rigidly follow a pre-defined plan may underlie at least some of the difference in game optimality between pretend and non-pretend games. Interestingly, however, we find no significant correlation between the pretend/non-pretend differences in flexibility and optimality in the first 5 clicks (<span class="math inline">\(r = -.07\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([-.15, .02]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(478) = -1.44\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .150\)</span>).</p>

<div id="suppression-or-simulation" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="1.6">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.6</span> Suppression or simulation?<a href="exp.-1-battleship-exploratory-results.html#suppression-or-simulation" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>At the end of the experiment, players were asked whether they had a strategy for pretending or for detecting pretense. I (MM) manually labeled their responses according to three criteria: mentions of suppression (e.g., “Trying to ignore the hints”), simulation (e.g., “Trying to imagine how I would react”), and rules (e.g., “Checking the corners and center before random selection of tiles”). Some answers got more than one label and some got none. Overall, 32 mentioned using suppression, 127 mentioned using simulation, and 220 mentioned following rules.</p>
<p>In the following analysis, we focus on the first two labels and sort players into two groups: 23 players who reported using suppression but not simulation, and 118 who reported using simulation but not suppression.</p>
<div id="click-optimality" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="1.6.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.6.1</span> Click optimality<a href="exp.-1-battleship-exploratory-results.html#click-optimality" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p><img src="figs/battleship-p_click-sup-sim-1.png" width="1800" /></p>
<p>The mean negative optimality score of non-pretend games was 6.45 among suppressors and 6.33 among simulators (<span class="math inline">\(t(25.42) = 0.45\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .655\)</span>). The mean negative optimality score of pretend games was 7.14 among suppressors and 6.64 among simulators (<span class="math inline">\(t(28.77) = 1.94\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .062\)</span>). Note that a higher score here means lower optimality. To the very least, simulators did as well as suppressors in pretending.</p>
</div>
<div id="rt-by-outcome" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="1.6.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.6.2</span> RT by outcome<a href="exp.-1-battleship-exploratory-results.html#rt-by-outcome" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p><img src="figs/RT_by_accuracy-sup-sim-1.png" width="1800" /></p>
<p>Visual inspection reveals similar temporal profiles in both groups (the higher standard error among suppressors is due to the lower number of subjects in this group). Specifically, in pretend games, cell selections that resulted in a hit were faster than those that resulted in a miss in both groups (suppressors: <span class="math inline">\(M = -735.59\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([-1,094.51, -376.68]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(21) = -4.26\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; .001\)</span>; simulators: <span class="math inline">\(M = -441.08\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([-543.74, -338.42]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(117) = -8.51\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; .001\)</span>), and cell selections that followed a hit were slower than those that followed a miss in both groups (suppressors: <span class="math inline">\(M = 322.87\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([27.88, 617.87]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(21) = 2.28\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .033\)</span>; simulators: <span class="math inline">\(M = 478.59\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([332.19, 624.99]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(117) = 6.47\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; .001\)</span>).</p>
